            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>An Egg</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) 
                in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, 
                mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl 
                with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. 
                It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy. </li>
                <li>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or 
                griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a 
                spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is 
                golden brown). </li>
                <li>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone 
                or with your favorite pancake toppings. </li>
